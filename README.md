# Soccer-Team-GA-Project
Genetic Algorithm for Optimizing Soccer Team Formation




This project uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to create the best possible soccer team lineup based on each player’s skills and position. The goal is to make the selection fair and based on performance, so we don’t have any personal bias when choosing the “World Team of the Year.”

Project Overview

The main aim of this project is to choose the best players for a soccer team. The GA helps by going through many combinations of teams to find the lineup with the highest skill level for each position, like goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward.

Key Features

- Player Skills and Positions: Each player has skills like speed, strength, accuracy, and teamwork. The GA selects the best player for each position according to the team formation rules.
- Fitness Function: The GA checks each team’s total skill level to pick the best team. If the team doesn’t meet the formation requirements, it gets a score of zero.
- GA Parameters: This project tested different population sizes and mutation rates to see how they affect the GA’s performance.
- Experiments: Different ways of combining and changing players (crossover and mutation strategies) were tested to find which ones worked best.

Experiments Conducted

1. Basic Test: The GA was first tested with a small team of 3 players without positions to make sure it worked.
2.	Adding Positions: Next, positions were added for each player, so the GA could form a real soccer team lineup.
3.	Testing Parameters: Experiments were done with different population sizes and mutation rates to understand their effects on the GA’s results.
4.	Trying Different Strategies: Various crossover and mutation strategies were tried and compared to see which ones found better teams.

Results Summary

•	Best Settings: Larger population sizes and higher mutation rates led to better team lineups and more stable results.
•	Crossover and Mutation Comparison: The main crossover and mutation strategies worked better than the alternatives in this project.

Future Work

•	Using Real Data: In the future, this GA could be tested with real player data for more accuracy.
•	Multi-Objective Optimization: Future versions of this GA could consider more player stats like goals and assists.
•	Using in Other Sports: This GA could be adjusted for other team sports, like basketball or volleyball.
